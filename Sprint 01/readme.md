# Basic Python: Golden Age of Television Analysis

## Project Description

This project explores the entertainment industry, focusing on the "Golden Age" of television which is considered to have started in 1999 with the premiere of *The Sopranos*. Our primary goal is to analyze a dataset containing records of movies and shows to investigate the relationship between the number of votes a title receives and its IMDb ratings. We specifically concentrate on TV shows, examining the assumption that shows with higher ratings also receive a higher number of votes.

Using Python and various data analysis tools, we delve into a comprehensive dataset to uncover insights about TV shows released during this golden era. This project offers an in-depth look at how popular acclaim (as measured by IMDb votes) correlates with critical success.

### Features and Functionality

- **Data Overview:** Examination of the dataset to assess quality and structure.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanup of dataset issues such as inconsistent column names and missing values.
- **Data Analysis:** Evaluation of the hypothesis that higher-rated shows receive more votes on IMDb.

## Deployment and System Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization (optional).

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis.

## Roadmap

- **Enhance Data Visualization:** Implement more sophisticated data visualization techniques to better communicate findings.
- **Expand Data Sources:** Incorporate additional datasets to enrich the analysis and validate findings across a broader spectrum of shows.
- **Automate Data Updates:** Develop a system to automatically update the dataset with new releases and ratings.

## Project Documentation and Configuration

Extensive documentation is available in the `docs` folder, covering detailed analysis steps and conclusions. For developers, a CLI tool is configured for running data processing scripts. Use `python run_analysis.py` to execute the analysis pipeline.
