    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are preparing a machine learning model for the OilyGiant mining company. The model will help the company determine the best location for a new oil well. The decision will be based on the analysis of oil samples from three different regions. Each region has different oil well parameters, including oil quality and volume of reserves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: We start by collecting the oil well parameters in the selected regions. This includes downloading and preparing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Training and Testing**: We then build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells. The data is split into a training set and a validation set and a model is trained for each region. The model’s performance is evaluated based on its predictions for the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Profit Calculation Preparation**: Next, we prepare for profit calculation. We store all key values for calculations in separate variables and calculate the volume of reserves sufficient for developing a new well without losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Profit Calculation**: We write a function to calculate profit from selected oil wells and model predictions. The wells with the highest predicted values are selected, and the profit for the obtained volume of reserves is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk and Profit Calculation: Finally, we calculate risks and profit for each region using the Bootstrapping technique. We find the average profit, 95% confidence interval, and risk of losses. Based on these results, we suggest a region for the development of oil wells and justify the choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use data science techniques to make informed business decisions. By the end of this project, we will have a recommendation for the best region to develop new oil wells based on the potential profit and risk of losses. Let’s get started!\n"

Despite having the lowest average volume of predicted reserves, it had a reasonable profit expectation and, most importantly, the lowest risk of loss and the only one of the three regions within the acceptable threshold.\n"
