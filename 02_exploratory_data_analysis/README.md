# Exploring Instacart Data

## Project Description

In this project, we delve into the shopping behaviors of Instacart users by analyzing a dataset provided by Instacart. Instacart, akin to Uber Eats and DoorDash for groceries, released this data in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. Our modified version of the dataset aims to retain the original distributions while ensuring faster computation and including challenges like missing and duplicate values for a more realistic data analysis experience.

Our analysis focuses on understanding various facets of user behavior, including order timing and frequency, product preferences, and reorder habits. Through this project, we aim to glean insights into how customers interact with the Instacart platform, assisting in optimizing the shopping experience.

### Data Description

The dataset consists of five CSV files:

- `instacart_orders.csv`: Orders placed by users
- `products.csv`: Information on products
- `order_products.csv`: Products included in each order
- `aisles.csv`: Aisle information for products
- `departments.csv`: Department information for products

Each file contains key information necessary for a comprehensive analysis, such as order times, product names, and user ordering habits.

### System Requirements

To run this analysis, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- pandas library for data manipulation.
- matplotlib library for generating plots.

These packages are essential for performing data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization tasks outlined in the `EDA_final_project_template.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
3. Install required Python packages using `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
4. Open the `EDA_final_project_template.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.

### Project Roadmap

- **Data Validation**: Extend validation checks to cover more edge cases in data, ensuring robust preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features from existing data to enhance analysis and uncover more insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Create an interactive dashboard using Dash or Streamlit for real-time data exploration.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the analysis as a web application to make it accessible to a broader audience.

This roadmap outlines our vision for evolving the project from a static analysis to a dynamic, interactive tool that provides valuable insights into consumer behavior on the Instacart platform.

### Contributions

This project is open for contributions. Whether it's improving the analysis, enhancing the data preprocessing steps, or suggesting new features, your input is welcome. Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to contribute.

For larger projects, collaboration and clear communication among team members are key. Contributors are encouraged to document their changes and discuss potential impacts on the project.
